		For this week was my last week physically in NYU. For this week we started again with a meeting with the entire team. In terms of the validator, I created a test site where the user can upload the CSS file which will be sent to the Javascript logic which then processes uploaded CSS file. For syntax validation, I used the CSSTree API and used some regular expression to display the validation output of the test site.
