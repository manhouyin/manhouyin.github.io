		This week started again with a group meeting where we summarized what everyone did last week, what, what trouble we have ran into, and what we plan on doing this week.
		<br>
		While looking into css validators last week, I realized that majority of the validators are written javascript and I was having a little hard time reading the javascript. So for parts of this week I look more into javascript, ES6, the react framework in order to have a better understanding of javascript. THen I went back to researching existing css validator. Finally for htis week I compiled a report on the various css validators I found and how they work.
