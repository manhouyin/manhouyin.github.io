            I arrived in Brooklyn by car on Sunday. And sccussfully moved inot the Eagle appartment. after setting everyting up. I went out ot explore a little and explore my new 
            jsurrounding and find a store to by some stuff. My room was also too bright for my eyes so I went needed to buy some black cloths to cover the windows better. 
            <br>
            On Monday I went to the orientation to kickoff the start of summer research program at NYU. After the orientation I went to NYU Tandon Metrotech 2 for the introduction 
            meeting with Amy and the other research students. 
            At the meeting I met Dr. Amy Hurst and the two other research students, Cartomou, and Prakriti. I also met Clair, a phd student who I will be working with. 
            <br>
            I talked iwth Clair about the scope and details about my research. For this week I would start with readings and tutorials about understanding WCAG, and WAI-ARIA. She 
            provided me with a list of tasks to complete.
