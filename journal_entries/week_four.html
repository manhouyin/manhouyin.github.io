	<p class="text_p">
		For this week we started with our weekly Monday meeting. During the meeting I learned of that I will be helping Amy and Claire writing a poster paper for the upcoming ACM ASSETS Conference. 
		I was very excited to be part of the paper writing process. 
		In preperation for the paper, I organized all the validators I have been researching on. 
		The information were organization by name, summary, features, accessibility, limitation, and use case.
