	<p class="text_p">
		This week started with the usual Monday meeting where we disccuss last week's progress and prospective work for this week. 
		The ACM Poster paper deadline is Wednesday July 10. So the first this week was mainly dedicated to finishing the work needed to complete the paper. I collected for information on in browser computed-styles. I also tested the various validators for accessibility. 
		Lastly I made preperations for my upcoming conference in Chicago.
