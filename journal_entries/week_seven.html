	<p class="text_p">
		For the majority of this week attended DisabilityIN's annual conference as part of the NextGen Leader and Talent Accelerator program. The conference took place from Saturday July 13 to Thursday July 18 in Chicago. Before the conference I was reached out by a good number of companies for an interview during the conference. The companies that I interview with where PNC Bank, Lockheed Martin, DuPont, Ultimate Software, Wells Fargo, Boston Scientific, Synchrony, Merck, Prudential Finance, Northrop Grumman, Bank of America,TD Bank,United Airlines, US Cellular, Verizon, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Boeing.

		As part of the Talent Accelerator, I particpated in a mini hackathon where my team and I developed an application that was later piched to the companies attendees at the conference. The application would be a platform that aggregates all disability services. My team and I was awared second place at the conference for our hack.

		After returning ƒrom the conference. I reached out to Claire, and we determined that the next step for the resaerch would be developing the validator. We determined that the validator would be in the form of the a website. So spent Friday and the weekend practicing ReactJS. 
		<br>
		I also bought a Udemy course "eep Learning Computer Vision™ Use Python & Keras to implement CNNs, YOLO, TFOD, R-CNNs, SSDs & GANs", I have held an interest in learning Computer Vision for a while and have decided to buy this course to start learning about it.
