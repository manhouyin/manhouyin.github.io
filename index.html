        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p class='text_p'>
            My project revolves around web accessibility. Specifically how to make web development accessible to blind and low vision individuals and screen reader users. When building websites screen reader users often require a third party member to validate CSS visually. In other work, the CSS validation process of web development is not completely accessible. The goal of my project would be to create a CSS validation tool that would allow screen readers to develop websites freely and independently without third-party assistant.
